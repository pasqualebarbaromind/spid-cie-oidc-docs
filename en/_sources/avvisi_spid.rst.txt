SPID regulatory references
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The **SPID System** start-up, for its nature and complexity, can require interventions on different aspects
with specifyings, clarifications, information notes and case studies, in order to provide support for a better
application and understanding of the SPID Regulations, already issued by AgID in compliancy to what prescribed
by the art. 4 of the DPCM 24 October 2014.

In order to organically gather such interventions and attribute them a character that involve application commitment by the involved actors in the SPID System, be they public or private, the present section **"SPID Announcements"** has been created, aimed at ensuring a uniform interpretation of the rules, the technical
aspects and what else might be necessary for the correct System operation as a whole. 

The present technical rules implement the following SPID announcements:
